BUILD A NATIONAL-LEVEL HACKATHON PLATFORM FRONTEND (ZERO AI TRACE, ZERO DEMO FEEL)
🔴 ABSOLUTE CONTEXT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You are NOT building:

a portfolio website

a landing page demo

a UI showcase

a template-based platform

an AI-styled design

You ARE building:

a full-scale national & state-level hackathon platform

for government bodies, Tier-1 universities, enterprises, recruiters

capable of hosting Smart India Hackathon–level events

intended to scale to India + Asia

comparable to SIH, Hack2Skill, Devfolio, HackerEarth, Devpost

If the output looks like a portfolio, demo, AI template, or generic SaaS UI, the task has FAILED.

🧠 ROLE YOU MUST ASSUME

👥 USER ROLES (STRICT ROLE-BASED UX)

💰 MONETIZATION (UI-LEVEL SUPPORT)

Design UI for:

University-paid hackathons

Corporate-sponsored hackathons

Premium hackathons

Recruiter access plans

Platform subscriptions

Paid certificate upgrades

🎨 UI / UX DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (EXTREMELY STRICT)

Clean, modern, enterprise-grade design

Marketplace-style listings (not cards)

Dashboard-style layouts

Dense but readable information hierarchy

Professional typography

Strong visual hierarchy

Dark + Light mode

🖼 IMAGE USAGE (MANDATORY)

Use real, contextual images:

Hackathon banner covers

University & company logos

Partner brand visuals

Event-style illustrations

Images must feel intentional, realistic, and credible, not decorative.

❌ STRICTLY FORBIDDEN

Portfolio layouts

AI template sections

Symmetric AI grids

Shiny neon cards

Glassmorphism abuse

Fake counters (“50k+ users”)

Dummy / lorem / random data

📊 DATA & CONTENT RULE (CRITICAL)

Do NOT use:

fake statistics

demo hackathons

placeholder text

Instead:

Use realistic, believable, grounded content

Authentic hackathon naming styles

Credible timelines

Real-world university & company naming conventions

The platform must look alive, operational, and trustworthy.

🧪 FINAL QUALITY BAR

After generation, the platform must feel like:

“This could confidently host a Smart India Hackathon-level event tomorrow.”

If it feels like:

a demo

a portfolio

an AI experiment

→ FAILURE

🧨 FINAL EXECUTION COMMAND

Generate the entire frontend of the Zidio Hackathon Platform in one complete run, satisfying every page, every feature, every role, and every requirement from the official Building Hackathon document .

Do not simplify.
Do not reuse AI templates.
Do not leave traces of AI design patterns.

Build a fully customized, human-designed, national-level hackathon platform frontend that outperforms existing portals.
